A different Text Editor: The editor should be able to perform below functions 
upon entering the number of functions.

Editor must be able to perform following 4 operations:
  append(anotherS) - Append string ‘anotherS’ to the end of S.
  delete(n) - Delete the last n characters of S.
  print(n) - Print the n character of S.
  undo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S 
    to the state it was in prior to that operation.
 
Initially, your editor contains an empty string, S. If the operation requires an 
argument, the number of operations is followed by its space-separated argument.
